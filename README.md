## Problem Statement


The Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of a company requires a comprehensive dashboard to monitor and analyze marketing performance across multiple dimensions. 

**The goal is to evaluate and optimize key marketing metrics, such as website traffic, customer acquisition, lead generation, social media engagement, and sales performance.**

However, the challenge is consolidating data from multiple sources into an intuitive, actionable format to allow the CMO to:

- Track sales performance and website traffic trends over time.

- Analyze the efficiency of marketing campaigns and budget spend.

- Assess the conversion rate of traffic to leads and customers.

- Monitor customer engagement across digital and social media platforms.

- Understand demographic data and the impact of different device and browser usage.

- Evaluate marketing budget allocation across different channels and its ROI.

To address these challenges, a Power BI CMO Dashboard was created with interactive visualizations spanning multiple KPIs, segmented across different dimensions such as traffic sources, device types, customer demographics, and marketing campaigns. 


**This dashboard empowers the marketing team with insights to drive decision-making, optimize strategies, and improve the company's overall marketing efficiency.**

### Project Overview:
The CMO Dashboard consists of three key pages, each addressing specific marketing metrics:

**Page 1 - Sales & Traffic Overview:**

- Visualizes the total sales, website visits, units sold, and unique customers.

- Breaks down performance by payment type, traffic type (organic vs paid), and traffic sources (e.g., content, social, search).

- Provides demographic insights on sales by age group and gender.
Includes a monthly breakdown of customer conversion rates, marketing leads, and website traffic.
